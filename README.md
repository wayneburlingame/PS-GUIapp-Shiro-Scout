## What is it?
A PowerShell Graphical User App.
## What ARCH is it built for?
Currently, I am focusing on x64, but with 32 bit compatibility.
## Is this for non-domain or domain-joined computers?
This version is for non-domain consumer use.
What is it's inteneded purpose?
A PowerShell GUI app I am currently working on is intended to be as universal Windows as possible by design. I would like to focus on tools, updates, and utilities use.
It is not inteneded as an app installer, virus scanning, registry tweaker, etc...
It is meant and intended as a mini dashboard to keep a PC updated and current with combined tools/information in one place.
Simply put, it's intended use is for the PC challenged type person.
