## Is this user/production ready?
No on your life... It is "Tinkerer Mode Ready"
## What ARCH is it built for?
Currently, I am focusing on x64, but with 32 bit compatibility.
## Is this for non-domain or domain-joined computers?
This version is for non-domain consumer use.
## What is it's inteneded purpose?
A PowerShell GUI app I am currently working on is intended to be as universal Windows as possible by design. I would like to focus on tools, updates, and utilities use.
## What is it not?
It is not inteneded as an app installer, virus scanning, registry tweaker, etc...
## How do I use it?
It is meant and intended as a mini dashboard to keep a PC updated and current with combined tools/information in one place.
Simply put, it's intended use is for the PC challenged type person.
## What it is...
Shiro Scout is meant as a mini updater for all the things we need to do to keep it updated. 
The idea struck me as I work in a corporate, business, multi-billion dollar company with the desktop and laptop users that the PC's were constantly falling behind in different updates, slowing performance, mass accumulated temmp files, cache files, etc...
What would start out as a 5-15 minute service request were turning into 2-4 hours of getting users updated.
Windows updates were not getting updated, remote users were not getting all security patches, virus definitions were getting behind.
Cached files and temp files were loading up thier computer. Browser cached files were causing issues with authentication, Office 365, and other issues.
So, here is this tool, and I will be working on it when possible, and if you have any generic/universal to Windows 10/11 commands that you think can be included please suggest it.
## Is there a domain-joined tool version?
Yes, there is a domain-joined version.
I am currently trying to work through a way to create the GUI App portion of the app, the framework,but not embed the button text or commands,
but instead, put them in files so that the gui interface will look the same but the app could be customized as needed with PS1 files, .bat, .cmd, or whatever else needs done, and the buttons be relabeled as needed to reflect the commands.
This would give the app much for flexibility.
